Every time I step on a plane, I think about how broken people will be if I don't step off.  I write like I have some nonchalance about this.  I do not; I suffer your loss for weeks before my departure.

I can feel how deeply you loved me.  I was lucky to cultivate so much love without much intentionality and with a significant amount of personal flaw.  Your generosity made me kinder to myself.  I hope you will know how grateful I am, or will have been, to have had you in my life.
