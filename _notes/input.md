title: Why input?

I have to think of this in terms of input.  Why?  Some reasons:

- Input is much more reliable than output.
- Output can be daunting.
- Output depends on inputs.
- Output is really just like cooking with your inputs.
- Output makes me fret about you.
- Input is about me.
- Input focuses on personal and unique experience of things.
- There is never a gap in input.

I'm not writing about things.  I'm writing about my experience with things.

A thing is not just one thing.  It is a different thing to different people.

That's as much as I can explain input at the moment, except to add that it seems to be working.
