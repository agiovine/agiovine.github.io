# Welcome!

I finally created this website (April 2024).  I'm still testing it though, so <span style="color:#f90185">it's going to be messy for at least a few days</span>. 

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  This website is where I process some inputs. Inputs are my experiences of things.
  <br>
  I do this in an Obsidian vault that I partially copy over here.
  <br>
  Here's an example [[imps|input]]. All inputs can be seen on a [[graph]].
  <br>
  <br>
  You can read more about me [[about|here]].
</p>

For information on the technical implementation of this website, see [[webtech|here]].

Now, the mess: I'm playing around with everything below the line!
